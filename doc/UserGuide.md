Full instructions on usage of Yucon

## 1 - Running Yucon
Yucon is a command line application and so it is usually run from a console like
Bash on Linux or Command Prompt / Powershell on Windows. There are two main modes
which Yucon can be run in:
1. **Single Use Mode:** Single use mode is where a single conversion is performed
   by typing it on the command line when first starting the program.

2. **Interactive Mode** Interactive mode is where Yucon takes over the console
   allowing you to continue typing conversions without invoking it again.
