Yucon is a simple but feature-rich unit conversion utility built especially for
use on the command line. It was designed with three things in mind:
  1. Empower the user. Make the program as intuitive as possible and provide a
     broad feature set.
  2. Modular design. Yucon is designed to be easily extensible. For instance,
     units are loaded procedurally from a file rather than being built into the
     program.
  3. Freedom. Yucon is free and open source to make it as useful as possible.

These are some of the features that Yucon supports:
  -  Direct conversion of units on the command line:
     Ex. $ yucon 25.4 mm in --> converts 25.4 millimeters to inches
  -  Interactive terminal mode
  -  Batch conversion from files
